3DProject
======================================================================
Compiling:

	just run make.
	(should work on linux and mac. Sorry Windows...)

======================================================================
What's it do?:
	
	Right now it's just a simple side scroller but I plan on adding a LOT more.

	Things to add:
	0. Health and stats
	1. Attacks (not sure what kind yet...)
	2. Enemies with which to attack
	3. Enemy attacks
	4. special jumps
	5. jetpacks are fun...
	6. A level editor instead of using text editor
	7. Objectives
	8. Story?...
	9. Shaders and textures!

	Sounds fun right?!

	This was wrote using C++ libraries of Opengl and SDL

======================================================================
Controls:
	
	So far:
	A and Left Arrow: move Left
	D and Right Arrow: move Right
	SpaceBar: Jumps
